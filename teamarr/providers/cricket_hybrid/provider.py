"""Cricket hybrid provider implementation (DEPRECATED — free tier fallback only).

Combines:
- TSDB: Team info, logos (from team_cache database)
- Cricbuzz: Event schedules, live scores

This abstraction lets the service layer treat cricket as a single provider,
unaware that data flows from multiple sources underneath.

DEPRECATED: When a premium TSDB key is configured, cricket leagues route
directly to the TSDB provider (full event coverage). This hybrid provider
only activates as a free-tier fallback when no premium key is set.
